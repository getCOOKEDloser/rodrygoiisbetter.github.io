        <p>Al-Nassr Football Club</p>
        <p>On December 30, 2022, after several weeks of speculation, the Saudi club Al-Nassr formalized the arrival of the Portuguese striker for two seasons. He will wear his favorite number, number 7. The press evokes a contract amounting to 200 million euros per year, making Ronaldo the highest paid footballer of all time. This choice is criticized by some football observers, including Jamie Carragher, who considers it a "sad end for him", or Gary Neville who adds that "we could have continued to see him at Old Trafford if the two parties had handled things differently”.

          On January 3, 2023, he was presented to the club's fans at Mrsool Park in front of 25,000 people. He declared during the press conference: “In Europe the work has been done, I have won everything and I am proud to have made this decision [...] The Saudi League is very competitive. But people don't know that. I don't care what people say about it. I am happy ".</p>
